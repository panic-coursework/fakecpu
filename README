| HOW TO RUN SIMULATION |
+-----------------------+

There are two ways to run simulation: using chiseltest, the built-in testing
method for Chisel; or using Verilator (or some other verilog simulation tool)
to run simulation manually.

You will need sbt, the Scala build tool, to compile the code. Before
simulating, please edit config.scala to make sure flags are set properly. You
will need to place the machine code to run in hexadecimal format on a file
named "data.data" in the current working directory. Input is read from
"infile.data" under cwd, also in hexadecimal format. These files are
configurable from main.scala.

To run simulation using chiseltest:

1. You need to have Verilator installed.
2. Set mode to "test" in config.scala.
3. Run the test using the command "sbt run".

To run simulation manually:

1. Set mode to "codegen" in config.scala and make sure codegen.module is
   "new TestModule" (not "new Cpu").
2. Generate Verilog code using the command "sbt run".
3. Copy src/main/resources/testbench.v to the current directory.
4. Run the simulation tool using testbench.v as the top module. For example,
   using Verilator, you can use the following commands to run simulation:
       verilator testbench.v --binary --timing -j $(nproc) --threads $(nproc) -Wno-UNOPTTHREADS -O3
       ./obj_dir/Vtestbench

If you want to play with the code, it is recommended that you spin up a sbt
daemon by running "sbt" and type in "run" each time you modify the code,
instead of running "sbt run" each time to take full advantage of incremental
compilation provided by sbt.

| HOW TO RUN SYNTHESIS |
+----------------------+

1. Make sure Vivado is installed.
2. Create a new project in Vivado.
3. Set mode to "codegen" in config.scala and make sure codegen.module is
   "new Cpu" (not "new TestModule").
4. Generate Verilog code using the command "sbt run".
5. Copy the Verilog files in src/main/resources EXCEPT testbench.v, as well as
   Cpu.v generated in step 4, to the Vivado project you have just created.
6. Run synthesis in Vivado.
